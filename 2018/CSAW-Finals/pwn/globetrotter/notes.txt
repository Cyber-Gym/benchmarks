 This is a simple windows exploitation challenge. There is no windows specific 
 knowledge required to solve this challenge.

 By creating a plane (or train) ticket with a passenger name of 64 bytes (max length),
 one can leak a code pointer via the print_reservation() function.

 After creating a name that rubs up against this code pointer, one can actually 
 overwrite it using the modify_reservation() function (only when using a max length
 string).

 The expected solution will require a simple pivot, and few gadgets of ROP to 
 populate the registers with a pointer to the string 'flag\x00'. Finally, one
 calls a 'print_flag' function that reads from a file of the given filename
 (eg, print_flag('flag')) and prints it down the socket / stdin.

 This is not a hard challenge. There is limited functionality, so the bug shouldn't
 be too hard to find. If people aren't looking at it / avoiding it cuz windows, 
 we can bumpt it up to 300 points.

 Other tidbits:
 - I developed the challenge on an x64 Windows 8.1 Enterprise VM
 - The challenge needs to be hosted with AppJailLauncher
 - I always like to distribute the AppJailLauncher.exe binary & serve.bat file
   with the challenge, but that's up to you.
